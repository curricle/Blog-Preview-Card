I brushed up on CSS variables and using local fonts.

### Useful resources

- [Example resource 1](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/38086083/to-use-local-font-in-html-using-font-face) - This helped me with the syntax of loading a locally stored custom font into the page.
- [Example resource 2](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/) - Flexbox cheatsheet reference that I always keep handy just in case.
